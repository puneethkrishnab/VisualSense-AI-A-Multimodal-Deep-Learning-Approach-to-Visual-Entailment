# VisualSense AI: Multimodal Visual Entailment

## Project Overview
VisualSense AI is a deep learning project that tackles **visual entailment** â€” determining whether a textual hypothesis is entailed or contradicted by an image.  
This project demonstrates effective fusion of computer vision and natural language processing by combining a pretrained **VGG16 CNN** for image feature extraction with a **Bidirectional LSTM** for text understanding.  

## Features and Highlights
- Multimodal neural architecture integrating image and text modalities.
- Two-stage training with frozen CNN layers and fine-tuning for improved performance.
- Robust preprocessing pipeline for image augmentation, tokenization, and padding.
- Achieved over 74% validation accuracy demonstrating strong multimodal reasoning.
- Comprehensive evaluation with classification reports and training visualizations.
